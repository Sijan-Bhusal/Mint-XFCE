 Network Manager CLI / TUI
nmcli device wifi show-password cannot live without it anymore, even shows you a QR code in terminal
nmcli device wifi finds all SSIDs, even hidden ones
nmcli radio wifi [on|off] and in general for other devices (bluetooth, wwan, etc).

nmtui is your best friend if you prefere a "terminal user interface"!
